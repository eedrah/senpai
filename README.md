# senpai
A list of ways senpai may or may not notice you.

## What is this, anyway?
This is a passion project by Kiera Manion-Fischer. She needed to come up with a creative way to get senpai to notice her, so she came up with this list of possible ways senpai might. Version 1.0.0 is a text-based list, but she hopes it will soon form the basis of a cute little fortune cookie website.

##Who is senpai, and why do you want them to notice you?
"[Senpai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senpai_and_k%C5%8Dhai#Senpai.2C_k.C5.8Dhai_and_gakusei)" is a Japanese honorific term meaning senior, somewhat similar to the word "mentor" in the West, but with a less strong relationship implied. [KnowYourMeme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-hope-senpai-will-notice-me) has a pretty good explanation of how the senpai meme got started.
